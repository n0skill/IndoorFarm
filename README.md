# Indoor farm

# Progress

## Initial tests

### Light source
Tests to evaluate the faisability of an indoor vegetable production using LEDs as the source of radiation.

Those tests will be applied to raddish and lettuce samples during several months to test the optimal light condidions.

### Substrate
After testing the light, various substrates will be used and compared.

### Water quality
After selecting the substrate, various water supplement will be used to further increase the samples quality and quantity.

## Increasing density

## Automation

## Large(r) scale production ??
