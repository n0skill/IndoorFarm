# Indoor farm

# Progress

## Initial tests

Those tests will be performed on raddish and lettuce plants and the generated results will then be used for optimisation.

### Light source
Tests to evaluate the faisability of an indoor vegetable production using LEDs as the source of radiation.

Those tests will be applied to raddish and lettuce samples during several months to test the optimal light condidions.

### Substrate
After testing the light, various substrates will be used and compared.

### Water quality
After selecting the substrate, various water supplement will be used to further increase the samples quality and quantity.


## Increasing density

## Automation

## Large(r) scale production ??


# Questions and answers
## Why use radish for this experiment ?

Because of their adaptability to various environment and the short time between sowing and maturity [1]


# Log

21.01.2018 - Plantation of pink radish with 5 LEDs (3 660nm, 2 450 nm) under constant light

23.01.2018 - Sprouting of the first seeds observed

24.01.2018 - All of the seeds have sprouted. Some sprouts are already some centimeters long. A white fluff is observed but is not a fungi. It's part of the natural way a radish seed sprouts.

25.01.2018 - Sprouts are still growning and look healty. Water was added in the morning.

29.01.2018 - Sprouts are now several cm long. Out of the 10, 4 that were longer than 7cm were planted in a larger container of normal dirt substrate and were placed under the same light wavelength as the seed (2 LEDs of 660nm, 2 LEDs of 450nm). The remaining seeds are left in the seedling pots.
